  "description" : "Adds a light augment effect of the appropriate level to all other augments.\ne.g. Damage II will have Light II. Augments without a level have Light III. \n\nThis will only affect newly applied augments.\n\nCompatibility:\nThis mod uses Starbound's patching system, so it should be compatible with all other mods and future game updates.\nOnly vanilla Starbound augments are affected.",
