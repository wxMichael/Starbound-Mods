# Light the Way
Adds a light augment effect of the appropriate level to all other augments.
e.g. Damage II will have Light II. Augments without a level have Light III.

This will only affect newly applied augments.

## Compatibility
This mod uses Starbound's patching system, so it should be compatible with all other mods and future game updates.
Only vanilla Starbound augments are affected.
